	I'm a nice, friendly, smart (hopefully) and somewhat lazy guy. I'm from delhi, though I've lived in quite a few places, since my dad is in the railways (now dont come to me about reservations and stuff). I've done my schooling from six different schools, so you get the idea. People think I'm kind of shy, but that's not really true, I just take time to open up. These lines are so long, I just cant fill them, so I'll jump to my hobbies.
